## Requirements

### 1. Add YAML Frontmatter to Documentation Files
Add consistent YAML frontmatter to all ~225 documentation files that are missing it.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All markdown files in docs/ have frontmatter with: title, description, category, lastUpdated, status
- Use template from docs/.meta/templates/
- Batch process files by directory to manage scope
- Priority: tutorials/, how-to/, reference/, explanation/ directories first

**Technical Notes:**
- Previous attempt hit context limits - use batch processing approach
- ~225 files need frontmatter based on quality-report.md
- Categories: tutorials, how-to, reference, explanation, ai-development

### 2. Migrate Unique Files from quikadmin/docs/

- Verify no broken links after migration

**Technical Notes:**
- See docs/.meta/quikadmin-docs-review.md for specific files

- Update quikadmin/CLAUDE.md references if needed

### 3. Archive Duplicate Files from quikadmin/docs/
