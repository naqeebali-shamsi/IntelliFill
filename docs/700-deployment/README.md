## Overview

This section contains guides for deploying QuikAdmin to various environments, from VPS servers to cloud platforms.

**Current Status:** Deployment strategy is still TBD. Docker support exists but production deployment target is undecided.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: VPS Deployment (Simple)

**Recommended for:** Small to medium deployments

**Stack:**
- Single VPS (2-4 cores, 4-8GB RAM)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- nginx reverse proxy
- PM2 process manager
- PostgreSQL (managed or local)
- Redis (managed or local)

**Cost:** $10-40/month

**Pros:** Simple, predictable, full control

**Cons:** Manual scaling, single point of failure

### Option 2: Platform-as-a-Service (Recommended for MVP)

**Recommended for:** MVP and early-stage deployment

**Stack:**
- API: Render, Railway, or Fly.io ($7-20/month)
- Frontend: Vercel or Netlify ($0-20/month)
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL (free tier or $19/month)
- Cache: Upstash Redis (free tier or $10/month)
- Storage: AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2 ($0.01/GB)

**Cost:** $0-50/month (free tiers available)

**Pros:** Zero DevOps, auto-scaling, built-in monitoring

**Cons:** Less control, vendor lock-in risk

### Option 3: Docker Deployment

**Recommended for:** Self-hosting with containers

**Current Status:** Docker Compose files exist in project

**Stack:**
- Docker Compose orchestration
- PostgreSQL container
- Redis container
- Application container
- Worker container
- nginx reverse proxy

**Use:** Development and testing, not yet production-ready

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables

```env
# Set NODE_ENV to production
NODE_ENV=production

# Use strong secrets (64+ characters)
JWT_SECRET=<generated-secret>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<generated-secret>

# Use managed database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/quikadmin

# Use managed Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://host:6379

# Configure for production
PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=warn
```

### Security Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Strong JWT secrets (64+ characters, 256+ bits entropy)
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Security headers configured (Helmet.js)
- [ ] Database credentials secured
- [ ] Environment variables not committed to git

## Monitoring (Planned)

**Tools:**
- Prometheus for metrics (docker-compose has monitoring profile)
- Grafana for visualization (docker-compose has monitoring profile)
- Winston for logging (already implemented)

**Enable monitoring:**
```bash
docker-compose --profile monitoring up -d
```

## Coming Soon

Detailed deployment guides for:
1. VPS deployment (DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr)
2. PaaS deployment (Render, Railway, Fly.io)
3. Environment configuration
4. Monitoring setup
5. Backup strategies
6. Scaling strategies

## Current Limitations

- No production deployment strategy defined
- No CI/CD pipeline for production
- No rollback strategy documented
- No load balancing setup
- No multi-region deployment

**Decision:** Deployment architecture will be defined in Phase 5 (after MVP is feature-complete).

---

**Note:** Detailed deployment guides will be added in Phase C of the documentation project.
