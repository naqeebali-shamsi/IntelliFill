## How-To Guide Philosophy

Guides in this section follow these principles:

1. **Task-focused** - Address a specific real-world problem
2. **No unnecessary explanation** - Focused on steps, not theory
3. **Flexible** - Adaptable to different situations
4. **Practical** - Solve actual problems users face
