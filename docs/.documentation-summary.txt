QuikAdmin Documentation Summary
================================
Created: 2025-01-10

New Documentation Files:
1. docs/CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md (41KB, 1,205 lines) - Architecture truth
2. docs/ARCHITECTURE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (9KB, 266 lines) - Quick overview
3. docs/README.md (8KB, ~300 lines) - Documentation hub
4. docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAP.md (5KB, 193 lines) - Navigation guide
5. docs/architecture/README-IMPORTANT.md (5KB, 137 lines) - Reality vs Vision

Total: ~68KB comprehensive documentation

Purpose:
- Document ACTUAL current architecture (not aspirational vision)
- Provide accurate context for Claude Code AI assistant
- Distinguish reality (monolithic Express) from vision (microservices)
- Enable rapid onboarding for new developers

Key Insight:
The existing docs/architecture/ folder contains FUTURE VISION (Kubernetes, microservices, Kong Gateway, ELK stack) 
that DOES NOT EXIST in code. New documentation makes this clear and documents what IS actually built.

Next Steps:
1. Reference docs/CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md for all architecture questions
2. Update CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md when code changes (weekly)
3. Keep architecture/ folder for future planning (quarterly updates)
4. Use ARCHITECTURE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md for fast lookups
