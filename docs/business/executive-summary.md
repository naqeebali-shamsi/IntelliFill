# IntelliFill Executive Summary

**AI-Powered Form Automation for UAE PRO Agencies**

---

## The Problem

UAE PRO (Public Relations Officer) agencies spend **4+ hours daily** on manual form filling.

### Pain Points

- **Repetitive data entry**: Same client information copied across dozens of forms
- **Error-prone**: Manual transcription leads to costly mistakes and rejections
- **Document chaos**: Client data scattered across passports, IDs, licenses
- **No memory**: Each new form requires re-entering the same data
- **Time sink**: Skilled PRO agents reduced to data entry clerks

### The Cost

|--------|---------------|
| **Time per form** | 15-45 minutes |
| **Forms per client** | 10-20 forms |
| **Error rate** | 5-10% require resubmission |
| **Agent hourly cost** | AED 50-100 |

---

## The Solution

**IntelliFill**: Upload documents once, auto-fill any form instantly.
