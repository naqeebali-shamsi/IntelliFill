## Development Environment

QuikAdmin is designed for **Windows native development**. While Docker support exists, we recommend running directly on Windows for better performance and easier debugging.

**Typical Startup:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
npm run dev  # Port 3002

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd web && bun run dev  # Port 5173

# Terminal 3: nginx (optional)
nginx  # Port 80
```
