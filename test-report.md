# Test Report - QuikAdmin

## Summary
- **Total Tests**: 93 tests across 11 test suites
- **Passing**: 53 tests ✅
- **Failing**: 40 tests ❌
- **Test Duration**: ~54 seconds

## Test Results by Category

### ✅ Unit Tests - FieldMapper (10/11 passing)
```
✅ should map exact field matches with high confidence
✅ should map similar field names
✅ should use entity matching for common field types
✅ should identify unmapped fields
✅ should calculate overall confidence correctly
✅ should handle empty extracted data gracefully
✅ should apply type validation boost for matching data types
✅ should respect minimum confidence threshold
✅ should handle special characters in field names
✅ should prioritize direct field matches over entity matches
❌ should handle large datasets efficiently (performance test - takes >1s)
```

### ⚠️ Backend Auth API Tests (1/4 passing)
```
✅ Health check endpoint should return 200
❌ Login should require email and password (rate limited - 429)
❌ Login with valid credentials should return tokens (rate limited - 429)
❌ Login with invalid credentials should return 401 (rate limited - 429)
```

### ❌ AuthService Unit Tests (0/18 passing)
- All tests failing due to mock setup issues with JWT secrets
- Need to properly mock bcrypt and jsonwebtoken modules

### ❌ E2E Tests
- Puppeteer tests failing due to timeout issues
- Need Chrome/Chromium setup for headless browser testing
- Tests attempting to connect to Chrome on port 9222

### ❌ Integration Tests
- API integration tests have import issues
- Some tests missing BASE_URL definitions

## Issues to Fix

1. **Rate Limiting**: Auth endpoint tests are hitting rate limits (429 errors)
   - Solution: Add delays between tests or mock rate limiter in tests

2. **Mock Setup**: AuthService unit tests need proper mocking
   - Solution: Fix JWT secret mocking and bcrypt/jsonwebtoken mocks

3. **E2E Setup**: Puppeteer tests need browser configuration
   - Solution: Install and configure headless Chrome

4. **Test Isolation**: Tests are not properly isolated
   - Solution: Add proper setup/teardown hooks

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Specific test suites
npm test -- --testPathPattern="unit/FieldMapper"    # ✅ Works
npm test -- --testPathPattern="backend/auth"        # ⚠️ Rate limited
npm test -- --testPathPattern="unit/AuthService"    # ❌ Mock issues

# With coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Force exit (prevents hanging)
npm test -- --forceExit
```

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Fix rate limiting in tests by:
   - Adding test-specific rate limit bypass
   - Or adding delays between auth tests

2. **Priority 2**: Fix AuthService unit test mocks:
   - Properly mock JWT modules
   - Set up test environment variables

3. **Priority 3**: Set up E2E testing:
   - Install Puppeteer properly
   - Configure headless Chrome

4. **Priority 4**: Clean up integration tests:
   - Fix import statements
   - Define missing constants

## Test Health Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Core functionality tests are passing
- Authentication flow verified manually
- Unit tests for business logic working
- Need fixes for full test coverage
