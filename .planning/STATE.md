## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Parallel flow, not replacement (PRO agents need existing power-user features)
- Person grouping defaults to separate (safer to let users merge)
- Confidence thresholds start at 85% (conservative, tune based on corrections)
- Confidence badges show semantic labels, not raw percentages

### Deferred Issues

None yet.
