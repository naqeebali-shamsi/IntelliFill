# Milestone v1.0: Smart Profile UX MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-16
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 19

## Overview

Transform IntelliFill's 6-step document-to-form flow into a streamlined 3-step "Upload → See → Fill" experience. Four phases deliver incremental value: foundation wizard, intelligent grouping/review, polish/UX refinements, and PRO agent features.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Working wizard that uploads documents, extracts data, and displays profile
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 6 plans

Key deliverables:

- `/smart-profile` route and SmartProfileWizard component
- SmartUploadZone with react-dropzone and auto-detection
- Backend `/api/smart-profile/detect-types` and `/api/smart-profile/extract-batch`
- Basic ProfileView showing extracted data
- Pipeline hardening (error handling, timeouts, rate limiting, validation)
- Honest confidence UI and extraction progress

Plans:

- [x] 01-01: Infrastructure & Routing (store, page shell, route)
- [x] 01-02: Smart Upload Zone (react-dropzone, detect-types API)
- [x] 01-03: Batch Extraction (extract-batch API, service integration)
- [x] 01-04: Profile View (display, inline editing, save to client)
- [x] 01-05: Pipeline Hardening (error handling, timeouts, rate limiting, JSON validation)
- [x] 01-06: Confidence UX (honest badges, extraction progress)

**Completed:** 2026-01-15

### Phase 2: Intelligence

**Goal**: Multi-person support and confidence-based review flow
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 4 plans

Key deliverables:

- PersonGrouper component with drag-drop reassignment
- ConfidenceReview step for low-certainty fields
- Field source tracking (which document, manual edit)
- Missing field detection against selected form

Plans:

- [x] 02-01: Entity Resolution Backend (fuzzball, Union-Find grouping, enhanced extract-batch)
- [x] 02-02: PersonGrouper UI (drag-drop with @dnd-kit, inline name editing)
- [x] 02-03: ConfidenceReview Step (low confidence fields, conflict resolution)
- [x] 02-04: Field Source & Missing Fields (FieldSourceBadge, MissingFieldsAlert)

**Completed:** 2026-01-15

### Phase 3: Polish

**Goal**: UX refinements and smart form selection
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 4 plans

Key deliverables:

- FormSuggester with document-to-form mapping
- Framer Motion animations for wizard transitions
- Assisted vs Express mode toggle
- Performance measurement (<3s detection, <10s extraction)

Plans:

- [x] 03-01: FormSuggester (form mapping utilities, FormSuggester UI, wizard integration)
- [x] 03-02: Wizard Animations (wizard-variants.ts, direction-aware transitions, reduced motion)
- [x] 03-03: Assisted/Express Mode (userPreferencesStore, ModeToggle, step-skipping logic)
- [x] 03-04: UI Polish & Verification (performance logging, visual consistency, user checkpoint)

**Completed:** 2026-01-16

### Phase 4: PRO Features

**Goal**: Power-user features for returning PRO agents
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 5 plans

Key deliverables:

- Client list and search accessible from Smart Profile
- Form usage analytics backend and dashboard
- SmartProfile-Client integration for save workflow
- Admin dashboard for accuracy metrics

Plans:

- [x] 04-01: Client Library (clientsService, clientsStore, ClientLibrary page)
- [x] 04-02: Form Analytics Backend (form-analytics.routes, formAnalyticsService)
- [x] 04-03: Form Analytics Dashboard (formAnalyticsStore, FormAnalytics page)
- [x] 04-04: SmartProfile-Client Integration (ClientSelector, save to client flow)
- [x] 04-05: Admin Accuracy Dashboard (admin-accuracy.routes, AdminAccuracyDashboard)

**Completed:** 2026-01-16

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Parallel flow, not replacement (PRO agents need existing power-user features)
- Person grouping defaults to separate (safer to let users merge)
- Confidence thresholds start at 85% (conservative, tune based on corrections)
- Removed "Verified" label - overstated AI certainty
- Four-tier confidence: High (95%+), Good (85-94%), Review (70-84%), Low (<70%)
- Entity resolution: AUTO_GROUP=0.95, SUGGEST=0.85, REVIEW=0.70
- Use fuzzball token_sort_ratio for name matching
- Union-Find algorithm for grouping efficiency
- PointerSensor with 8px activation distance (prevents accidental drags)
- Auto-skip review when all fields high confidence
- Default to 'assisted' mode for new users (safer)

**Issues Resolved:**

- OCR confidence scores now exposed to frontend with semantic labels
- Multi-person uploads now supported with drag-drop grouping
- Form selection guided by smart suggestions
- Performance timing visible in dev mode

**Issues Deferred:**

- Mobile app (web-first approach)
- Offline mode (real-time is core value)
- Advanced form templates (PRO feature for future milestone)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- PRO features (04-01 through 04-05) are scaffolded but not MVP priority
- Some pre-existing TypeScript errors in modified files from prior work
