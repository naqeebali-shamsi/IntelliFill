# Plan 06-02: Navigation Consolidation

## Context

**Phase**: 6 - UX Cleanup
**Requirements**: UX-08, UX-09
**Goal**: Simplify navigation from 8-10 items to 5-6 items, rename jargon

## Prerequisites

- Plan 06-01 completed (search bar removed)
- Frontend running (`cd quikadmin-web && bun run dev`)

## Tasks

```xml
<task id="06-02-01" title="Rename Smart Profile to My Profile" requirement="UX-09">
  <context>
    "Smart Profile" is internal jargon that means nothing to users.
    "My Profile" is universally understood. Update navigation and any references.
  </context>
  <files>
    <file path="src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx" action="modify">
      Change navigation item from "Smart Profile" to "My Profile"
    </file>
    <file path="src/pages/SmartProfile.tsx" action="modify">
      Update page title/heading if it says "Smart Profile"
    </file>
  </files>
  <verification>
    - Sidebar shows "My Profile" not "Smart Profile"
    - Page heading says "My Profile"
    - Route can remain /smart-profile (URL doesn't matter as much)
  </verification>
</task>

<task id="06-02-02" title="Consolidate navigation to 5-6 items" requirement="UX-08">
  <context>
    Current navigation has 8 base items + 2 admin items = 10 total.
    Too many choices cause decision fatigue. Consolidate to essential items.

    Current items:
    1. Dashboard
    2. Smart Profile → My Profile (from 06-02-01)
    3. Clients
    4. Documents
    5. History
    6. Templates
    7. Knowledge Base
    8. Settings
    + Admin: Users, Audit Logs

    Proposed consolidation:
    1. Dashboard (keep)
    2. My Profile (keep - core feature)
    3. Documents (keep - merge Clients conceptually)
    4. History (keep - important for tracking)
    5. Templates (keep - frequently used)
    6. Settings (keep - necessary)

    Remove/merge:
    - Clients → Users manage clients within Documents flow
    - Knowledge Base → Move to Settings or remove if unused
  </context>
  <files>
    <file path="src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx" action="modify">
      Remove Clients and Knowledge Base from baseNavigation array
      Keep 6 essential items: Dashboard, My Profile, Documents, History, Templates, Settings
    </file>
  </files>
  <verification>
    - Sidebar shows exactly 6 navigation items (+ admin items for admins)
    - Navigation feels cleaner and more focused
    - All essential features still accessible
  </verification>
</task>
```

## Verification

After all tasks:

1. **Navigation count**: Exactly 6 base items visible
2. **Naming**: "My Profile" appears instead of "Smart Profile"
3. **Functionality**: All removed items' functionality still accessible via other paths
4. **Admin items**: Admin-only items still show for admin users

## Notes

- This plan depends on 06-01 being done first (search bar removed)
- If users complain about removed items, they can be restored with a "More" dropdown
- Knowledge Base content should remain accessible, just not in primary nav
